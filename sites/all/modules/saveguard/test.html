<div class="guide-wrap page-content"><h3>Understanding the Basics</h3>

    <div class="guide-inner-text"><h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>There are rules and regulations you must follow in order to legally rent out your residence. First, determine
            whether you are eligible to rent out your residence. If you meet the eligibility requirements, you must then
            consider details such as how long you would like to host guests and whether you will be on the premise when
            you have guests. These decisions affect how much you can earn and how many days per year you can rent out
            your residential unit. Anyone in San Francisco who earns rent from a short-term residential rental is
            considered a business and may owe taxes. You must obtain a Business Registration Certificate and pay
            applicable taxes (through the Treasurer and Tax Collector’s Office) and register with the Office of
            Short-Term Rentals.</p></div>
    <h3 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Important Terms</h3>

    <div class="guide-inner-text"><h4 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Host</h4>

        <p>Hosts rent a portion or the entire premise of their residential unit to guests for periods of less than 30
            nights. Some hosts receive payment through online companies that handle short-term rental bookings and some
            receive payment directly from the guest. All of these transactions are subject to San Francisco tax
            laws.</p><h4 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Permanent Resident</h4>

        <p>A permanent resident can be either a property owner or a tenant. To qualify as a permanent resident, you must
            live in the unit for at least 275 nights of any given calendar year. Regardless of whether you are a
            property owner or tenant, you may only register the specific unit in which you reside. If you are a new
            resident, you must have lived in your unit for at least 60 consecutive days before you can apply to be on
            the Short-Term Residential Rental Registry.</p><h4 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Short-Term Residential
            Rental</h4>

        <p>Rental of all or a portion of your residential unit for periods of less than 30 consecutive nights is
            considered a Short-Term Residential Rental. If you rent out your unit while you are present, you may do so
            for an unlimited number of nights per year. If you are not present, the maximum is 90 nights per year.</p>
        <h4 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Business Registration Certificate</h4>

        <p>All San Francisco businesses- even the small ones- must register with the Treasurer and Tax Collector. If you
            meet certain requirements as a short-term residential rental host, you can apply online for your Business
            Registration Certificate. Hosts who apply online will receive their temporary Certificate via email within
            minutes of registering.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Business Account Number (BAN)</h4>

        <p>When you receive your Business Registration Certificate, you will be given a BAN that can be used to complete
            online tax filings in the future. Hosts who apply for a Business Registration Certificate online will be
            given a temporary BAN in order to register with the Office of Short-Term Rentals.</p><h4
                style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Short-Term Residential Rental Registry</h4>

        <p>In addition to the Business Registration Certificate from the Treasurer and Tax Collector’s Office, qualified
            hosts must register with the Office of Short-Term Rentals. Once you register, you will receive a
            registration number that allows you to legally rent out your residence.</p><h4
                style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT)</h4>

        <p>San Francisco residents who rent out any portion of their residence must collect a 14% tax on the rental
            amount that they charge their guests. This tax is paid by the guest, so the guest will be charged 14% on top
            of your listed rental fee.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Certificate of Authority (COA)</h4>

        <p>Hosts must apply for a Certificate of Authority, which gives permission to collect taxes from guests and
            remit them to the City. All hosts need a COA unless you only use a Qualified Website Company for your
            listings, or you earn $40,000 or less in rent per year and request to be designated as a Small Operator.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Small Operators</h4>

        <p>Hosts who have a Business Registration Certificate can apply online to be designated as a “Small Operator.”
            Small Operators can file the TOT on an annual basis rather than monthly, and do not need a Certificate of
            Authority. To qualify, you must make $40,000 or less per year from renting out your residence.&nbsp;</p><h4
                style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Qualified WebsiteCompany (QWC)</h4>

        <p>Qualified hosting platforms can collect the TOT on behalf of the host and remit the taxes to the City and
            County of San Francisco. If you use one of these hosting platforms, then you do not have to obtain a
            Certificate of Authority or collect and remit TOT for any transactions booked through the site. Currently,
            Airbnb is the only hosting platform that is a Qualified Website Company.</p>

        <p class="note"><span class="note-heading">Note</span> <br/>We highly recommend that you familiarize yourself
            with these terms and refer back to this section as you begin to set up your Short-Term Residential Rental
            business.</p></div>
    <h3>Determine Eligibility</h3>

    <div class="guide-inner-text"><h4>Are you eligible?</h4>

        <p>Before you begin filling out any applications, make sure you understand the requirements listed below. In
            order to register on the Short-Term Residential Rental Registry, you must meet ALL of the following
            conditions:</p>

        <p>- You must be the Permanent Resident (owner or tenant) of the residential unit that you wish to rent
            short-term. This means you must live in that specific residential unit for at least 275 nights of any given
            calendar year. If you are a new resident you must have occupied this specific unit for at least 60
            consecutive days prior to your application. If you own a multi-unit building, you may only register the
            specific residential unit in which you reside.</p>

        <p>- You must obtain a San Francisco Business Registration Certificate from the San Francisco Treasurer and Tax
            Collector’s Office. (See next section for instructions.)</p>

        <p>- You must obtain liability insurance in the amount of no less than $500,000, or provide proof that liability
            coverage in an equal or higher amount is being provided by any and all hosting platforms through which you
            will rent your unit.</p>

        <p>- Your residential unit must not have any outstanding Planning, Building, Housing, Fire, Health, Police, or
            other applicable City code violations. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>- You may only register one residential unit where you are the Permanent Resident.</p>

        <p>- You are NOT eligible to register if your residential unit is subject to the Inclusionary Affordable Housing
            Program, designated as below market rate (BMR), or contingent on income restrictions under City, State, or
            Federal law, or if the unit has been the subject of an Ellis Act eviction that occurred after November 1,
            2014.</p>

        <p class="note"><span class="note-heading">Note </span><br/>If you are a tenant and not the owner of a
            residential unit, we strongly recommend that you review your lease before submitting an application. The
            registration of your residential unit with the Office of Short-Term Rentals does not override any lease
            agreements, homeowner’s association bylaws, Covenants, Conditions &amp; Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs), or any
            other agreement, law, or regulations that prohibit subletting or use of your unit as a Short-Term
            Residential Rental. Please note that lease agreements, homeowners' association bylaws, and CC&amp;Rs are
            private agreements that are not enforced by the City and County of San Francisco.</p></div>

    <h3>Fulfill Tax Obligations</h3>

    <div class="guide-inner-text"><h4>Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT)</h4>

        <p>Anyone in San Francisco who receives rent for a stay of less than 30 days must collect a 14% tax on the
            amount that they earn from their guests. This is called the “Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT),” and depending
            on the amount of rent that you bring in, this tax is due either monthly or annually.&nbsp;</p><h4>Annual
            Filing</h4>

        <p>If you make $40,000 or less from renting out your residence, then you can apply to be a “Small Operator”
            during the time of your business registration. Small Operators can file their TOT on an annual basis, and DO
            NOT need a Certificate of Authority. <a href="http://sftreasurer.org/hosts" target="_blank">Declare you are
                a Small Operator to the Treasurer and Tax Collector</a>.</p><h4>Monthly Filing</h4>

        <p>If you earn more than $40,000 per year, then you must file your TOT on a monthly basis. To do so, you must
            obtain a <a href="http://businessportal.sfgov.org/node/2788" target="_blank">Certificate of Authority</a> in
            order to have the right to collect the TOT.</p><h4>Qualified Website Company (QWC)</h4>

        <p>If you rent out your unit using ONLY a Qualified Website Company (hosting platform that can collect taxes and
            remit on your behalf), then you do not have to collect and remit the TOT or obtain a Certificate of
            Authority.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="note"><span class="note-heading">Note </span> <br/>Currently, the only hosting platform that is a
            Qualified Website Company is Airbnb. If you ONLY list your residence on Airbnb, you do not need to collect
            TOT or obtain a Certificate of Authority. If you list your residence on Airbnb and other hosting platforms,
            you must still follow the guidelines above to fulfill your tax obligations on earnings from non-Airbnb
            hosting platforms.</p><h4>How to calculate the TOT</h4>

        <p>The TOT is based on the total amount that a guest pays, including charges designated as “service fees (e.g.
            cleaning fee)” or “advertising fees.” For example, if a guest is charged $110 plus a $20 “service fee,” the
            taxable rent is $130. The tax would be 14% of $130, which is $18.20. To collect the TOT, the party that
            receives the rent payment adds TOT to the rent and collects both at the same time. &nbsp;In this example, a
            guest would be charged $110 + $20 + $18.20 = $148.20. &nbsp;The party receiving payment from the guest must
            provide a receipt. &nbsp;The receipt must separately state the amount of TOT collected.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4>

    <h3 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Create a Listing</h3>

    <div class="guide-inner-text"><h4>List Your Property</h4>

        <p>Now that you’ve completed all the steps above to be complaint, list your short-term residential rental on a
            hosting platform of your choice. Make sure that your Short-Term Residential Rental Registration Number is
            visible at the top of your listing’s description. Once you have finished your listing, email the URL for the
            listing to the Office of Short-Term Rentals at str.confirmation@sfgov.org.</p></div>
    <h3 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">What if...</h3>

    <div class="guide-inner-text"><h4>Business Registration &amp; Tax Obligation Questions</h4>

        <p>Q: What if I want to include the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) as part of my rental fee? Am I allowed to do
            that?</p>

        <p>A: The party that receives the rent payment adds the TOT to the rent and collects both at the same time. To
            calculate TOT, multiply the rent charged by 14%. The party receiving payment from the guest must provide a
            receipt. The receipt must separately state the amount of TOT collected.</p>

        <p><span
                style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Q: What if I want to add a service fee to the rental price?&nbsp; </span>
        </p>

        <p>A: If you add a service fee, then it is also subject to TOT. The TOT you collect will be 14% of the guest’s
            payment plus the service fee. For example, if a guest is charged $110, plus a $20 “service fee,” the taxable
            rent is $130. The TOT would be 14% of $130, which is $18.20.</p>

        <p>Q: What if the website company I am using charges me a fee or commission? How does affect calculation of TOT?&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A: Arrangements between a host and a website company do not affect calculation of TOT. TOT is calculated
            based on the amount paid by the guest. The obligation to submit the full amount of TOT owed applies jointly
            to the host and the website company.</p>

        <p>Following up on the last example, suppose an agreement exists between a website company and a host that the
            website company will retain 20% of the $110 charge ($22) as a “commission” on the rental transaction, and
            the website company will also retain the $20 service fee. Therefore, the website company retains $42 and
            passes along $88 to the host. The rent charged to the guest is still $130, regardless of how the website
            company and the host have agreed to divide those funds. The TOT is still 14% of $130: $18.20. The full
            amount of rent received ($130) must be reported on San Francisco TOT filings. When a host uses a website
            company that does not fulfill this obligation, the host remains responsible for TOT reporting and remitting
            obligations. In this example, the host would report $130 rent received – not $88 – and would remit $18.20 in
            TOT.</p>

        <p>Q: What if I use a hosting platform that is not a Qualified Website Company to advertise my rental unit?</p>

        <p>A: You are responsible for collecting the TOT and remitting it to the Office of Treasurer &amp; Tax
            Collector.</p>

        <p>If you use a non-QWC platform to advertise your unit and the platform collects guests’ payments before
            forwarding them to you, then both you and the platform are jointly responsible for collecting the TOT and
            making sure that the Office of Treasurer &amp; Tax Collector receives the TOT paid by the guest. The Office
            of Treasurer &amp; Tax Collector may collect the TOT plus interest and penalties, from either operator – the
            website company or the host.</p>

        <p>Q: Is there any way for a host who works with a non-QWC to avoid having to deal with collecting TOT, getting
            a Certificate of Authority, and submitting monthly TOT filings?</p>

        <p>A: If you earn $40,000 or less from short-term rental income per year, then you can apply to be a Small
            Operator. As a Small Operator, you can file and pay the TOT annually by January 31. If you earn more than
            $40,000 per year, then you must obtain a Certificate of Authority and pay the TOT on a monthly basis.</p>

        <p>Q: What if I don’t know how to estimate the amount I will earn at the time that I register as a business?&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A: You should provide your best estimate. If you begin as a Small Operator ($40,000 or less per year) but
            your rent collected exceeds $40,000, you will need to contact the Treasurer and Tax Collector’s Office to
            update your filing and payment schedule, and obtain a Certificate of Authority.</p>

        <p>Q: What if I want to change or update the information I submitted on my Business Registration Application or
            the questions about my tax filing status?</p>

        <p>A: <a href="https://etaxstatement.sfgov.org/accountupdate/" target="_blank">Submit a request</a> with the
            information you need to update to.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Q: What if I’ve already registered and paid TOT before Airbnb became a Qualified Website Company?</p>

        <p>A:&nbsp;<a href="http://sftreasurer.org/hosts" target="_blank">Update your account information</a> at so
            that you stop getting monthly “reminders to file,” and get notified about refunds for registration fee and
            TOT already submitted.</p>

        <p>Q: What information is public?</p>

        <p>A: A public list of registered business locations in San Francisco is maintained by the Office of
            Treasurer-Tax Collector, including business locations that have been sold, closed, or moved out of San

                style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Q: What if I started my short-term rental business a few years ago? </span>
        </p>

        <p>A: The application for a new business registration will ask you for your start date. If you owe TOT for any
            prior periods, the Treasurer and Tax Collector will contact you with instructions for how to file and pay.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Q: What if I received a letter from the Treasurer and Tax Collector about hosting, but I am no longer in
            business?</p>

        <p>A: Anyone who operates a business in San Francisco (including hosts) must register. If you have already
            stopped operation, you may register and submit a close of business form at the same time. If you owe
            registration fees or TOT for any prior periods, the Treasurer and Tax Collector’s Office will contact you
            with instructions for how to file and pay.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Q: What if I declare that I use a QWC exclusively but then decide to list my unit on another platform or rent
            to a friend?</p>

        <p><span style="line-height: 20.0063px;">Q: What if I receive rent for stays that are 30 days or longer? </span>
        </p>

        <p><span style="line-height: 20.0063px;">A: Rent for stays that are 30 days or longer are not taxable. TOT only applies for rent received for stays that are less than 30 days. You do not need to include stays that are 30 days or longer in any TOT filings or payments.&nbsp; </span>
        </p><h4>Short-Term Residential Rental Registry Questions</h4>

        <p>Q: What if I want to rent out more than one unit?</p>

        <p>A: You can only rent out your residential unit, which is where you live for a minimum of 275 nights per year.
            If you own multiple properties, you can only rent out the residential unit in which you reside. You may have
            multiple listings for different rooms withinthe same residential unit (for example, different bedrooms). You
            can list each room separately and must email links to all of your listings associated with the one
            registered residential unit to the Office of Short-Term Rentals at str.confirmation@sfgov.org.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>You can rent out your unit for a maximum of 90 nights per year if you will not be present at the time of your
            guests’ stay. You can rent out your registered unit for an unlimited number of nights only if you will also
            be living (staying overnight) in the unit during your guests’ stay.</p>

        <p class="note"><span class="note-heading">Note </span> <br/>Anyone in San Francisco who earns rent from a
            short-term residential rental (less than 30 days) is subject to tax regulations- even if the operation of
            the business is in violation of the eligibility guidelines. If you are earning money from guests, or if you
            have operated a short-term rental in the past, you must register as a business and pay taxes. The
            information you share with the Treasurer and Tax Collector is confidential.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Q: What if I move and want to rent out my new place?</p>

        <p>A: You must <a href="http://sftreasurer.org/hosts" target="_self">add a location to you business
            registration account</a> with the Treasurer and Tax Collector.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>- You must have lived in your new unit for a period of 60 consecutive days. Once you have met the minimum
            residency requirement, you can register your new unit with the Short-Term Rental Registry. You will not have
            to do anything to take your old unit off the Registry; it will automatically be invalidated when you apply
            for your new registration, and the old unit will not be eligible for short term rental unless a new occupant
            reapplies.</p>

        <p>Q: What if I no longer want to rent out my residence? &nbsp;Do I need to file anything to close my
            business?</p>

        <p>A: You must <a href="http://businessportal.sfgov.org/manage/close-your-business" target="_blank">close your
            business</a> with the Treasurer and Tax Collector.</p></div>
    <h3 style="line-height: 20.0063px;">After Opening</h3>

    <div class="guide-inner-text"><p>- Create or adjust your listing so that the registration number is visible above
        the description of your listing. The Office of Short-Term Rentals also recommends that hosts visibly display
        their certificates in their unit.</p>

        <p>- Send the Office of Short-Term Rental an email at str.confirmation@sfgov.org with links to all of your
            listings.</p>

        <p>- Renew your Business Registration Certificate on a yearly basis. Your business registration is valid from
            July 1-June 30 of each year. You must renew your business registration by May 31 each year in order for it
            to be valid on July 1 of the same year.</p>

        <p>- File and pay any TOT owed (not applicable for hosts who only do business via a Qualified Website Company).
            For Small Operators, your annual tax filing and payment is due by January 31st. For all other hosts, your
            filing and payment is due monthly. All TOT transactions are online.</p>

        <p>- Renew your Short-Term Residential Rental Registration every two years.</p></div>
