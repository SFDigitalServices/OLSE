<p>There are rules and regulations you must follow in order to legally rent out your residence. First, determine whether
    you are eligible to rent out your residence. If you meet the eligibility requirements, you must then consider
    details such as how long you would like to host guests and whether you will be on the premise when you have guests.
    These decisions affect how much you can earn and how many days per year you can rent out your residential unit.
    Anyone in San Francisco who earns rent from a short-term residential rental is considered a business and may owe
    taxes. You must obtain a Business Registration Certificate and pay applicable taxes (through the Treasurer and Tax
    Collector’s Office) and register with the Office of Short-Term Rentals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If
